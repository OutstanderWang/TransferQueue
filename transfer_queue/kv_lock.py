"""Advisory locks on TransferQueue KV keys.

``kv_local_lock`` and ``async_kv_local_lock`` hold an exclusive mutex per
``(partition_id, key)``, shared by every thread and asyncio task of this process. They
are advisory: KV calls never check them. They do not exclude other processes or Ray
actors. Waiters on a key are served in FIFO order. Nesting is rejected; pass all keys
to a single call. ``kv_local_locked`` and ``async_kv_local_locked`` run one KV call
under the lock without repeating its keys and partition.

``kv_global_lock`` and ``async_kv_global_lock`` do the same across the Ray cluster through
``TransferQueueLockManager`` actors that split keys by hash, under a lease that renews
automatically. Take a global lock before a local one, never inside it. ``kv_global_locked``
and ``async_kv_global_locked`` mirror the local wrappers.

"""The unit process must exit when the thread that answers requests dies.

Worker and proxy both run as daemon threads, so an exception in either only unwinds that
thread: the process stays up with its ROUTER still bound, keeps accepting connections and
never answers them, and every caller blocks until its own timeout. Exiting instead turns a
silent hang into a visible actor failure.
